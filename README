This program was made in collaboration with my programming partner in 
CSE111(Advanced Programming), an upper division C++ course at UC Santa Cruz.

Skeleton code was provided to us by our instructor Wesley Mackey. 
Our implementation of the code can be found in main.cpp, listmap.h, and listmap.tcc

Details about the assignment and the features of the code can be found in asg3-listmap-templates.pdf
