This program was made in collaboration with my programming partner in 
CSE111(Advanced Programming), an upper division C++ course at UC Santa Cruz.

Skeleton code was provided to us by our instructor Wesley Mackey. 
Our implementation of the code can be found in main.cpp, listmap.h, and listmap.tcc

This program implements template code without using any template classes from the std library.
Input is read and cleaned then executed as commands. A linked list data structure is used where
data is stored in keys and values of a specific node. 

Further details about the assignment and the features of the code can be found in the file:
